        Add a player to a room (player.room = 'room.id' and if room is not full then room.players += player.id )
     - player.SetQuiet('this.id', 'this.isQuiet', 'amount of time - optional')

** Plan
Here is what we expect to have:

   - Connection
   - player.add
   - room.create
   - room.chat.enabled =1
   - room.changeCards
   - Game.begin
     - room.chat.enbaled =0
     - iteration
       - Cupidon
       - Loups
       - Voyante
       - Sorci√®re
     - winning test
     - room.chat.enabled=1
     - player.vote
     - room.vote
     - player.vote.flush
     - winning tests if(1){Game.end}
       else{Game.begin}

This is a brief version taking some shortcuts, we may code the complete game at once without showing the obvious uses of room.chat.infoToAll or room.chat.infoToClass.
But we'll add the complete wiaitng process when we'll have defined the rest.
